            My name is Ethan Cornwell and my current focus is a career change
            from the pharmaceutical industry towards something that I've always
            had an deep found interest in, Software Development.

            A little backstory, I was born and raised in Oregon. My family moved
            often but finally settled in Newport on the West Coast.

            From an early age, my sister and I worked for our parents at our
            family owned plant nursery business. It was in Newport where I met
            my wife Maya and where we made the decision to move to Colorado in
            2012.

            In 2013, my daughter Harper was born and in 2017, my son Oliver.

            From Aug. 2013 - Oct. 2021, I worked in an Aseptic cleanroom
            environment, producing and managing a sterile injectable product
            used to treat prostate cancer. Although I loved the work and the
            ability to impact the lives of others, there were many contributing
            factors which lead to my leaving the field.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Now comes a new exciting chapter in my life where I will be pursuing
            the knowledge and skills required for software development or
            something in the related field.
